# Arpehem-s-proton-pack-code
This is the code to use if you can only find or realyzed you bought a common cathode bargraph.
This code is designed to be used with 2 Arduino nanos or your favorite boards that have at least as many i/o ports and handles Arduino in order to minimyze the amount of wires running from the wand to the pack.

Features:
- Common cathode bargraph full animations
- aRGB 4x5mm aRGB wand tip LED lights
- Functional top and front wand knobs
- Bargraph volume display
- Full pack aRGB controled
- New N-filter realistic smoke purge system
- DYI smoker build
- Uses DFplayer mini
- Customisable sound amplification

Upcomming updates:
- Firing tail sound 
- Game modes
- Top knob functionality

Which code to use?
- Use Neutrino wand code for the nano placed in the wand.
- Use Cyclotron_single_lights on your pack nano if you have single aRGB cyclotron lights.
- Use Cyclotron if you have 7 LED aRGB pucks for your cyclotron. Know that this code may be outdated, only single lights version is being worked on trough the end of this project as it was a design decision change but I wanted to include the option to use what you have/want and update the code yourself. (I was almost done I beleive and it is functional)
